# Weather Machine

Flask Weather Webapp. Can be hosted or ran as an offline python script. Pulls from wrrt/in

## Getting Started

To use the weather machine, download the repository and run 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

 and run 
 
 `flask run --0.0.0.0` to start the webservice or `python WeatherMachine.py` to run the service on device

### Important: running the webservice locally will not be able to get Device Location for Local Weather. It can only be accessed from outside a local network or using the on-device function
